### What is the population of Des Moines?
According to the US Censes Gov, The Population of Des Moines is 214,237, and its population density is 2,515.6 inhabitants per square mile. The area of the city is roughly 90.66 mi².

### Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?
Citibikes are normally used as short distance transportation. This is due to the fact that there is a 30 minute timer on each bikes; therefore, it cannot travel too far from its original location. From the data, it can be seen that the average citibike duration in NYC is 17.50 minutes. 

Due to the fact that citi-bikes are short distance travel transportations and that Des Moines' population distrubtion around the city is much lower, the population does have an effect on the bike-sharing program. In other words, typical travel distances and duration within Des Moiness will be much higher than that of New York City. 

Additionally, if we compare citibike's usertypes with average trip duration. It seems that the normal customer that is not subscribed to the Citibike service tends to travel alot further than that of a subscriber. At the same time, the distribution of total users between customers and subcribers also weights into this, where the majoritiy of citibike users are subscribers. 

In other words, the population who uses citibikes tends to be long-term subscribes who travel short trip durations. This means that population density and the size of the city does have an effect on bike-sharing programs.
